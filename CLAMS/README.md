# Visual Quality Measure for estimating cluster ambiguity

We introduce a visual quality measure (VQM) called CLAMS uses a statistical model derived from perceptual data to automatically assess cluster ambiguity in monochrome scatterplots In this interactive demo, you will experience the functionality of CLAMS. You will observe applying CLAMS to a scatterplot to measure cluster ambiguity. You can upload scatterplot data in JSON format (holding 2D array) or select the provided sample scatterplots through a drop-down menu. Once you have drawn or uploaded the scatterplot as desired, wait a few seconds for CLAMS to compute cluster ambiguity.
